# Flower-Classification-DeepLearning
### This project uses the ResNet50 deep learning model for classifying different flower species from images.
## **üìÅ About Dataset**
The dataset used for this project can be found here:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/flower-classification

- train/: Contains the images of flowers used for training the model, divided into subdirectories based on flower species.
- test/: Contains the images of flowers used for testing the model's accuracy.

## **Table of Contents:**
- Introduction: This notebook demonstrates how to classify different flower species using deep learning and the ResNet50 model.
- Data Preparation: Loads and preprocesses the dataset, organizes it into training and validation sets.
- Model Building: Uses the ResNet50 pre-trained model and fine-tunes it for flower classification.
- Model Training: Trains the model on the dataset and evaluates its accuracy.
- Model Evaluation: Includes visualizations such as loss curves, accuracy curves, and confusion matrix.
